# Training Fraud detection in Hadoop

On-Line Fraud Detection involves identifying a fraud as soon as it has been perpetrated into the system. This technique is only successful by having a training algorithm that can produce a model suitable to be used by a real-time detector. In this project, we will focus on fraud detection for credit card transactions, using Markov chains to train the model off-line and a parallel implementation of a concurrent queue for on-line detection.
